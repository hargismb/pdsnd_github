### Project Title
Bikeshare project

### Description
This program dsplays bikeshare data for a six-month period, calculates statistics, and can also display raw data by month, day of week, both, or neither. It covers Wahsington, DC; New York City; and Chicago.
This is my second take, ideally without conflicts to merge.

### Files used
just bikeshare.py for the program

### Credits
Programmed at the behest of Udacity's nanodegree program
